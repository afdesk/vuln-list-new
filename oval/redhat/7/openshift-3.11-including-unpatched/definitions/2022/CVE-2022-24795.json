    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: yajl-ruby is a C binding to the YAJL JSON parsing and generation library. The 1.x branch and the 2.x branch of `yajl` contain an integer overflow which leads to subsequent heap memory corruption when dealing with large (~2GB) inputs. The reallocation logic at `yajl_buf.c#L64` may result in the `need` 32bit integer wrapping to 0 when `need` approaches a value of 0x80000000 (i.e. ~2GB of data), which results in a reallocation of buf-\u003ealloc into a small heap chunk. These integers are declared as `size_t` in the 2.x branch of `yajl`, which practically prevents the issue from triggering on 64bit platforms, however this does not preclude this issue triggering on 32bit builds on which `size_t` is a 32bit integer. Subsequent population of this under-allocated heap chunk is based on the original buffer size, leading to heap memory corruption. This vulnerability mostly impacts process availability. Maintainers believe exploitation for arbitrary code execution is unlikely. A patch is available and anticipated to be part of yajl-ruby version 1.4.2. As a workaround, avoid passing large inputs to YAJL. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Enterprise Linux only ships YAJL 2.x versions and on 32-bit systems, more than 2GiB of data will be required for triggering this bug. However, on 64-bit systems, more than 9EiB of data will be needed, making this vulnerability very hard to be exploited on these systems.\n            MITIGATION: Avoid passing large inputs to the YAJL library.",
