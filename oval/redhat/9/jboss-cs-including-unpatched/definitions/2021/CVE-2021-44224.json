    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: There's a null pointer dereference and server-side request forgery flaw in httpd's mod_proxy module, when it is configured to be used as a forward proxy. A crafted packet could be sent on the adjacent network to the forward proxy that could cause a crash, or potentially SSRF via misdirected Unix Domain Socket requests. In the worst case, this could cause a denial of service or compromise to confidentiality of data. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw does not affect httpd configurations that do not use forward proxy functionality (configurations where ProxyRequests is turned off).\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
