  "Identifier": "CVE-2021-3761",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/cloudflare/cfrpki",
  "Title": "Out-of-bounds Write",
  "Description": "Any CA issuer in the RPKI can trick OctoRPKI into emitting an invalid VRP `MaxLength` value, causing RTR sessions to terminate. An attacker can use this to disable RPKI Origin Validation in a victim network (for example AS - Cloudflare) prior to launching a BGP hijack which during normal operations would be rejected as `RPKI invalid`. Additionally, in certain deployments RTR session flapping in and of itself also could cause BGP routing churn, causing availability issues.",
