    "Description": "A sandbox bypass vulnerability in Jenkins Pipeline: Deprecated Groovy Libraries Plugin 583.vf3b_454e43966 and earlier allows attackers with permission to define untrusted Pipeline libraries and to define and run sandboxed scripts, including Pipelines, to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM. Pipeline: Deprecated Groovy Libraries Plugin 588.v576c103a_ff86 no longer contains the library step. It has been moved into the Pipeline: Groovy Libraries Plugin.",
