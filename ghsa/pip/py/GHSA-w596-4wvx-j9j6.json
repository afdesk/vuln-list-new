    "Description": "The py library through 1.11.0 for Python allows remote attackers to conduct a ReDoS (Regular expression Denial of Service) attack via a Subversion repository with crafted info data, because the InfoSvnCommand argument is mishandled.\n\nThe particular codepath in question is the regular expression at `py._path.svnurl.InfoSvnCommand.lspattern` and is only relevant when dealing with subversion (svn) projects. Notablely the codepath is not used in the popular pytest project.",
