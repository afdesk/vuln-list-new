 "ExtendedDescription": [
  "Because the information is stored in cleartext (i.e., unencrypted), attackers could potentially read it. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.",
  "As data is migrated to the cloud, it can be easier for attackers to access the data from anywhere on the Internet."
