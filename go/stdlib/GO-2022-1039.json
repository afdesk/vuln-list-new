  "details": "Programs which compile regular expressions from untrusted sources may be\nvulnerable to memory exhaustion or denial of service.\n\nThe parsed regexp representation is linear in the size of the input,\nbut in some cases the constant factor can be as high as 40,000,\nmaking relatively small regexps consume much larger amounts of memory.\n\nAfter fix, each regexp being parsed is limited to a 256 MB memory\nfootprint. Regular expressions whose representation would use more space\nthan that are rejected. Normal use of regular expressions is unaffected.\n",
