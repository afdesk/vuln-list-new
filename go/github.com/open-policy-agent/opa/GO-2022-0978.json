  "details": "Open Policy Agent (OPA) is an open source, general-purpose policy engine.\nThe Rego compiler provides a (deprecated) `WithUnsafeBuiltins` function,\nwhich allows users to provide a set of built-in functions that should be\ndeemed unsafe and rejected by the compiler if encountered in the policy\ncompilation stage.\n\nA bypass of this protection is possible when using the `with`\nkeyword to mock a built-in function that isn't taken into account by\n`WithUnsafeBuiltins`.\n",
