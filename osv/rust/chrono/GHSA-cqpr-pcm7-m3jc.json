  "summary": "Potential segfault in `localtime_r` invocations",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nUnix-like operating systems may segfault due to dereferencing a dangling pointer in specific circumstances. This requires an environment variable to be set in a different thread than the affected functions. This may occur without the user's knowledge, notably in a third-party library.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNo workarounds are known.",
